**Semantic Versioning**
This project adheres _somewhat_ to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). 
The first version of a MAJOR or MINOR release will exclude the second dot followed by zero (`.0`).
For example `2.0` will be used rather than `2.0.0`. Otherwise Semantic Versioning is strictly followed.
